* General

  *hcharselect* lets you quickly copy UTF-8 characters to the clipboard
  for your pasting pleasure.

  [[file:screenshots/hcharselect.png]]

* Usage

  hcharselect currently requires kcharselect's data file. You can get it
  somewhere at kde.org or by installing kcharselect on your system.

  By default it tries to open =/usr/share/apps/kcharselect/kcharselect-data=.
  You can specify another file at the command line.

** Invocation

   The basic command line syntax is:

   : hcharselect [-d kcharselect-data-file]

** Modus Operandi

   Just type your search string in the entry box at the top and you will
   instantly get a list of matching UTF-8 characters in the list below. If the
   search string is shorter than 3 characters, you have to press /Enter/ to
   explicitly start the search.

   To select a character from this list, type ~Tab~ to switch to the list,
   navigate to the right row with ~j~, ~k~, ~Down-Arrow~ or ~Up-Arrow~ and
   hit ~Enter~ again.

   This will make hcharselect go away and your character appear in the primary
   X-selection.

** Keybindings

   - Entry box:

     - Enter		:: Start search
     - Tab              :: Switch to list box

   - List box:

     - j/k		:: Move one row down/up
     - Down-/Up-Arrow	:: Same as j/k
     - Tab              :: Switch to entry box
     - Enter		:: Copy character and exit
     - Shift-Enter      :: Copy character but don't exit

* Installation

** Prerequisites
   
   You will need GHC and cabal first. The other dependencies are listed in the
   =hcharselect.cabal= file and can be installed either with cabal or your
   distribution's package manager.

   HCharselect also needs the =xclip= program at runtime.

** Building and Installing

   Simply use the following commands:

   : runhaskell Setup.hs configure
   : runhaskell Setup.hs build
   : sudo runhaskell Setup.hs install

   Type ~runhaskell Setup.hs configure --help~ to get possible compile-time
   configuration options.
